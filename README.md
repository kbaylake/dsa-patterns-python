# Data Structures & Algorithms – Pattern-Based Practice (Python)

> Pattern-based Data Structures & Algorithms practice in Python with consistent daily problem solving and clear explanation of approaches.

This repository contains my structured practice of Data Structures and Algorithms using Python, with a strong focus on problem-solving patterns rather than isolated problems. The goal is to build deep conceptual understanding, write clean and efficient solutions, and develop strong fundamentals for technical interviews and real-world problem solving.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by core DSA patterns and data structures:

-Arrays & Strings
-Binary Trees
-Dynamic Programming
-Graphs
-Greedy
-Hashing
-Linked Lists
-Queues
-Recursion
-Stacks
-Trees


Each folder typically contains concept-focused notebooks, pattern explanations and intuition, representative problems, clean Python implementations, and time and space complexity analysis.

## 📌 Daily LeetCode Practice

The `DailyLeetCode/` folder contains consistent daily problem-solving practice. Each problem includes problem intuition, step-by-step approach, edge cases, and optimized Python solutions.

---

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach

- Pattern-based thinking (sliding window, two pointers, backtracking, etc.)
- Focus on generating only valid states
- Pruning redundant computations where possible
- Emphasis on clarity, correctness, and efficiency
- No copy-paste solutions

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Standard Python libraries

---

## 🎯 Objective

To strengthen algorithmic fundamentals required for software engineering interviews, competitive programming foundations, and real-world problem solving.

---

## 📈 Status

Ongoing — the repository is actively updated with new problems and refined explanations.
